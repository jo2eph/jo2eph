<h1>WORK IN PROGRESS...</h1>

<h1>Intro</h1>
<p>
  Hello! I am <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-lee-243516242/">Joseph Lee</a>. 
  I am an alumni from <b>UC San Diego</b> with a major in <b>B.S. Applied Math</b>.

  I pursued a math degree for three main reasons:
  A) I knew that I wanted to be in a STEM major; B) I didn't know what I wanted to do; C) math was my strongest subject in high school.

  I initially came to UCSD as a <i>pure math</i> major, but as I took more courses--especially the theoretical and proof-heavy ones--I quickly 
  realized that I wasn't interested in the theoretical or abstract aspect of math; I was more interested in the applied aspect. I wanted to learn how I can apply
  my knowledge and skills. Furthermore, I consider myself a very interdisciplinary person: I am interested in learning many subjects and fields, and I don't want my
  learning to be restricted to just my field (math). Thus, being an applied math major gave me the flexibility to take courses in other fields, such as data science,
  computer science, engineering, business, etc..
  
  I met a lot of amazing people at UCSD and I am glad to have spent my time forging connections and continuing my education at UCSD.

  Here are some of my favorite UCSD courses (in no particular order):
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Data Science in Practice (COGS 108)</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Project-based data science course</li>
        <li>Learned about data science ethics, visualization, geospatial analysis, machine learning, large language model, etc</li>
        <li>Gave me hands-on experience with teamwork, cooperation, communication, leadership in a data science context</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Intro to Mathematical Software (MATH 157)
      <ul>
        <li>Think of this course as a CS course in a math course</li>
        <li>We learned how we can use software and programming language (Julia) in a mathematical context</li>
        <li>Each week, we learned different topics (number theory, combinatorics, graph theory, statistics, cryptography, etc) and how we can use programming for them</li>
        <li>Very applicable math course with no proof-writing</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Intro to Computational Statistics (MATH 185)
    </li>
    <li>
      Principles of Data Science (DSC 10)
    </li>
    <li>
      Applied Linear Algebra (MATH 102)
    </li>
    <li>
      Hidden Data in Random Matrices (MATH 182 / DSC 155)
    </li>
  </ul>

  A list of programming languages I know or have used at UCSD:
  <ul>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>Java</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>MATLAB</li>
    <li>Julia</li>
    <li>R</li>
    <li>C</li>
    <li>C++</li>
  </ul>
